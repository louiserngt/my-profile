	<h3>PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
<p>
	I started photography five years ago. The thing that I like the most in photography is <strong>playing with the light and the colours</strong> as well as <strong>doing portraits</strong>. I used to have an Instagram account for my photography, but I got fed up with my pictures, so I stopped it. Instead of trying to get recognition and likes on social medias, I am now trying to <strong>improve my work</strong>.

	<h3>TRAVELLING</h3>
<p>
	I don't travel very often, but when I do, the thing that I like the most is going either to <strong>big cities</strong>, or <strong>getting lost in nature</strong>. My <strong>dream travel</strong> would be to go to <strong>New Zealand</strong>. Travelling has great benefits such as building someone's personality or interests.

	<h3>READING</h3>
<p>
	I always loved reading books. I read a lot of <strong>thrillers</strong>. I am currently reading the Da Vinci Code saga, by Dan Brown. Reading helps me to <strong>focus on something</strong> while I am not feeling well. I would even say that reading makes me <strong>live the lives I would never have!</strong> It truly has <strong>great benefits</strong> when it comes to <strong>developing the mind and the imagination</strong>.
